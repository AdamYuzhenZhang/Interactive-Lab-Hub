# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

## Part A. Plan 

### Scenario

Under the social pressure and other psychological aspects of depression and anxiety, increasing numbers of young urban dwellers choose to self-isolate in their bedrooms with minimal physical contact with the outside world. This phenomenon is also known as Hikikomori. 

The furry ball device mimics a cute furry cat that aims to construct an emotional bond with the Hikikomori person, who could release his/her stress through petting the furry ball, without worrying about the cost and mess of a real cat. The furry ball reacts to the player through colored lights. It also flashes to alert and remind the player to eat/work/sleep on time, and gradually encourages him/her to embrace a more organized lifestyle.


_Setting:_ In the living space of a reclusive urban dweller

_Players:_ The Hikikomori person and his/her friends

_Activity:_ The players pet the furry ball by touching different parts of it, and the furry ball reminds the player to do tasks on time through lights of different colors.

_Goals:_ Stress relief and emotional sustenance.

### Storyboard

### Feedback

Think carefully about color coding. Warmer colors could represent both happiness and alerts. 

The color can flash at different frequencies to indicate various emotions. It can even flash morse code to “talk” to the player.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

The interaction was tested using Tinkerbelle on my phone. The color response when petting the device works really well but the colored light is too dim to attract attention while the player is concentrating on something else. A brighter light or an ambient indoor light might be needed to draw players attention.

The new idea of using different colored lights to remind the user to eat, work, or sleep on time occurred to me from the acting. Instead of the player feeding the pet, this furry ball could remind the player to have food during lunch hour by flashing red lights. Therefore, the player could be viewed as the pet of the device, which helps him/her stay organized. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

The Tinkerbelle works really well for static color. However, flashing color or color changes could not be controlled easily. It would be helpful if I could create a timeline of a sequence of colors, or record some flashing patterns and easily play it while testing the interaction.

## Part D. Wizard the device

## Part E. Costume the device

![plot](https://github.com/AdamYuzhenZhang/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/DeviceCostume.jpg)

The key feature of the device costume is that it could be personalized at low cost. Around the core of the processing components of the device, a soft and furry skin is added, which can not only be removed for cleaning purposes, but also be changed to skins of different colorations and textures. Custom holiday or cosplay costumes are available for the player. 

The processing core contains several touching sensors to feel the player’s gestures. With connection to wifi, the device could access data from the player’s computer or smart furniture to know the player’s status, in order to generate notifications timely. 

The costume used in the interaction studies is a stuffed toy with a phone attached to it.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

**Below is the feedback I received from school mates through Canvas.**

Rebecca Lassman:

	Really great idea!! I think the idea of helping people with anxiety/depression establish a healthy routine is an extremely interesting and important place to be innovating!! Your sketches are amazing and videos are really well done. They get across the look and feel of the device and the use case. A few remaining questions: Is the furry ball a robot/can it move on its own? Does it intuit what the person needs or is it on a schedule set by a third party (e.g. therapist or family member)? Would there be text on the screen or how would the user know what the colors mean?

	In terms of the video: I see a fluffy ball that sends reminders to a person to do various activities throughout the day (go to sleep, go outside etc.). The device also encourages the person to interact with it like a pet but without the stress of a pet.

Angela Chen:

	Hey Yuzheng! This is so cute :) I love your inspiration from Hikikomori and the idea of the furry ball! My only feedback would be about the color choices for different moods, and it would be a good idea to list a standard color sheet that each represents a category or mood.

Yunzhu Pan:

	This is a really cool idea! I especially enjoyed the level of details in your storyboard and sketches, including the scenarios and inner-designs of your device.

	One thing I do have some questions about though, is the ultimate effectiveness of this device, in regards to its goal of “stress relief and emotional sustenance”. As for a Hikikomori person, would the ultimate goal be encouraging a more socially-connected life with the society, or to provide an emotionally self-sufficient in-doors life? Or does it not need a well-defined goal at all and just focus on the emotionally-supporting interaction, and leave the decision of its purpose to the user？

	Another thing that came to my mind is the power supply of the device. In your sketch, the device is powered by a battery (forgive me if I’m wrong), and I think a potential problem of battery power supply is that the battery changing process could break the pet-like companion illusion this device is trying to create. Having to open up this device and change its battery might bring inconsistencies in the pet-like experience you’re trying to give the user. Maybe a solar battery would be better? (So that the device can sit under the sun and charge itself like an actual act, instead of needing battery changes.)

	Overall this is a great idea and the feedback above is a stretch. Cool work!

**After discussing the project with classmates in class, I received several additional comments:**

In contrary with Rebecca and Yunzhu’s love of the task-notification functionality, Ken suggested that I could focus more on the idea of a pet, and invent more ways to pet the furry ball, such as adding multiple sensitive spots to it, or letting the player use a sequential set of petting gestures to make the ball super happy. The entire task-notification system could be removed. 

Similar comments were received regarding communicating moods and warnings. Besides different colorations, I could invent animated facial expressions for mood, add vibrations for tactile feedback, or use sound to “talk” to the player.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

## Part A. Plan

Based on the feedback I received, I decided to add the following additional features to make the furry ball more responsive and interactive as a pet, while keeping the task-notification function and allowing the player to customize tasks through mobile apps.

**Vibration**

Adding a vibration system that generates tactile feedback when the furry ball is being pet

**Sound**

Adding a sound system that purrs when being pet and meows when alarming
  
**Visual**

Designing facial expressions to be displayed on the screen to communicate moods
  
**Accessory**

Designing a sitting pad for it that supports wireless charging
  
Designing different costumes for it
  
**Software**

Designing more pet-like interactions that let the player explore different petting gestures to make the furry ball happy

### Storyboard

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

I designed a series of facial expressions that the furry ball could use to represent mood and compiled a video to animate the expressions and the color transitions. The video was played on a phone that is embedded into the stuffed toy. Additionally, I added animal-mimicking sound to the video to strengthen the interactions and vibration audio to represent physical vibrations.

The facial expressions work extremely well at representing mood. However, the animal-mimicking sound is distracting during interactions and I decided to completely remove it in the following steps. The vibration audio really helps with mimicking physical vibrations without an actual motor. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

Instead of using Tinkerbelle, this time I choose to customize my own animations with Premiere Pro. Below is the composed video I am using for prototyping the device. The vibration audio is integrated in the video

## Part E. Costume the device

The plastic shell in the previous design is replaced by Poly-fil synthetic fiber stuffing to create a soft and squeezable touch while giving structural support to internal components. Within the skin of the device, haptic motors, wireless charging unit, and multiple touch sensors are added. A pad that supports wireless charging (the stuffed turtle in my staging interaction video) is added to make power transfer unnoticeable to the player. I also designed several costumes for possible further customization based on the player’s preferences.
