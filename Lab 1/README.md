# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

# Scenario

Under the social pressure and other psychological aspects of depression and anxiety, increasing numbers of young urban dwellers choose to self-isolate in their bedrooms with minimal physical contact with the outside world. This phenomenon is also known as Hikikomori. 

The furry ball device mimics a cute furry cat that aims to construct an emotional bond with the Hikikomori person, who could release his/her stress through petting the furry ball, without worrying about the cost and mess of a real cat. The furry ball reacts to the player through colored lights. It also flashes to alert and remind the player to eat/work/sleep on time, and gradually encourages him/her to embrace a more organized lifestyle.


_Setting:_ In the living space of a reclusive urban dweller

_Players:_ The Hikikomori person and his/her friends

_Activity:_ The players pet the furry ball by touching different parts of it, and the furry ball reminds the player to do tasks on time through lights of different colors.

_Goals:_ Stress relief and emotional sustenance.

# Feedback

Think carefully about color coding. Warmer colors could represent both happiness and alerts. 

The color can flash at different frequencies to indicate various emotions. It can even flash morse code to “talk” to the player.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

The interaction was tested using Tinkerbelle on my phone. The color response when petting the device works really well but the colored light is too dim to attract attention while the player is concentrating on something else. A brighter light or an ambient indoor light might be needed to draw players attention.

The new idea of using different colored lights to remind the user to eat, work, or sleep on time occurred to me from the acting. Instead of the player feeding the pet, this furry ball could remind the player to have food during lunch hour by flashing red lights. Therefore, the player could be viewed as the pet of the device, which helps him/her stay organized. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

The Tinkerbelle works really well for static color. However, flashing color or color changes could not be controlled easily. It would be helpful if I could create a timeline of a sequence of colors, or record some flashing patterns and easily play it while testing the interaction.

## Part D. Wizard the device

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype.

## Part E. Costume the device

The key feature of the device costume is that it could be personalized at low cost. Around the core of the processing components of the device, a soft and furry skin is added, which can not only be removed for cleaning purposes, but also be changed to skins of different colorations and textures. Custom holiday or cosplay costumes are available for the player. 

The processing core contains several touching sensors to feel the player’s gestures. With connection to wifi, the device could access data from the player’s computer or smart furniture to know the player’s status, in order to generate notifications timely. 

The costume used in the interaction studies is a stuffed toy with a phone attached to it.

## Part F. Record

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
